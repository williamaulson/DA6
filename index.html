<h2>Inferior Megaman Knock Off</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The Inferior Megaman Knock Off is a game where players try to defeat each other in a two-dimensional environment.
<p>NOTE: The music audio file does not seem to play on occassions. This appears to be related to a delay in the browser that loads it.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should experience the challenge of manipulating their avatar character to attack their opponent while also avoiding their opponent's own attacks.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This game is in the two-dimensional platformer genre. It can also be classified as a fighting game.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Player one moves their avatar left and right with the "A" and "D" keys respectively. Player one jumps by pressing the "W" key, performs a regular attack with the Spacebar, and performs a fire attack with the "M" key. Player two moves their avatar left and right with the respective arrow keys. Player two jumps by pressing the up arrow key, performs a regular attack with the Enter key, and performs a fire attack with the Numpad + key. Both players move their avatars in a two-dimensional space and use their attacks in an attempt to damage their opponent enough times to defeat them.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The goal of this prototype is to have players learn the importance of timing when making their avatars attack and move. Knowing when to attempt an attack and when to avoid or even to not move their avatars is an ability that should improve with a player's increasing experience of the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The movements of the player's avatars are very precise and can be altered in mid-jump. This allows for quick reactions from the players and can reward more skilled players. The combat space is a relatively small, fixed area which reduces the need for players to memorize the environment's level design.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The gameworld is a representation of the security system of a stranger's cell phone. The avatar characters represent programs. The avatar attacks are various functions.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You have found a stranger's cell phone. What devastating secrets does it hold? Control your hacking program as you attempt to defeat the phone's security. Can you break into the phone and ruin a stranger's life? Will automated technology prove too much for your nefarious human mind?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone is encouraged to play, the graphic violence is mild. However, the game could be seen as promoting the invasion of individual's personal life which may make it inappropriate for some.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Each gameplay session should last no more than a minute.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players can only have so many attacks active at any time. This leads to two primary strategies. One strategy involves players attempting to fill the play area with as many of their attacks as possible while focusing on avodiance. The other strategy involves players conserving their attacks until their opponent is in a vulnerable position in an attempt to maximize damage.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Avatar characters taken from Phaser tutorial. All other image assets made by internal design team. All audio assets taken from the Megaman series.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The NES Megaman games. Street Fighting games.
